# chat-server

A simple websocket server built with Ktor-server.

Check out the ktor documentation for more info: [ktor websockets](https://ktor.io/docs/servers/features/websockets.html)

I use this sever as the backend to a chat application that I built with [jetpack compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).
You can check out the [chat app](https://github.com/OtienoSamwel/simple-chat) and try it out with a friend.
